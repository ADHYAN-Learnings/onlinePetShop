Small-breed foods are specifically designed with appropriate levels of key nutrients and smaller kibble sizes to suit smaller mouths. This also encourages chewing and improves digestion.','01.>The mischievous, comical Affenpinscher dog breed is one of the oldest breeds, dating back to the 17th century. In Germany, where it originated, the word \'affen\' means to mock and \'pinscher\' means terrier. The Affen is the ancestor of two other breeds, the Griffon Belge and the Griffon Bruxellois, who also have a face described to be similar to that of a monkey. Although Affen dogs may show all the pluck of terriers, they are too small to be working dogs and are kept chiefly as companions. 02.>The Affen dog breed is lively and self-confident though on occasion, strong-willed and fearless, though very affectionate with his owners. They tend to be mindful of strangers making socialising as a puppy essential.','The Affenpinscher dog breed is generally healthy. However, like many small breeds, they can suffer from kneecaps that may temporarily slip out of place (luxating patellas), a hip condition and a windpipe problem.'),(2,'Male','Large breed dogs benefit from a different balance of nutrients including minerals and vitamins compared to smaller-breed dogs. Afghan Hounds are prone to bloating and stomach problems; smaller, more frequent meals can help minimise this risk.','01.>A noble, dignified-looking hound, the Afghan dog stands proudly and elegantly, with his long, lustrous coat as his crowning glory. A large breed, these adult dogs measure 68 to 74cm in height, with bitches slightly less at 63 to 69cm. The glorious coat comes in all colours – from black to silver, with every colour, pattern and combination in between! An average weight is around 25kg, with an approximate range of 20 to 27kg depending on the dog\'s sex and build. 02.>Often aloof with strangers, early socialisation is a must for this regal dog, as is early puppy training – particularly with recall. With his family and those he knows, there\'s no hint of standoffishness – he is wonderfully loyal and loving. The Afghan dog is built to run and he is never happier than when sprinting at full speed, the wind in his hair, chasing a ball or a squirrel that he\'s spotted.','The Afghan dog breed is generally healthy and robust, with few breed specific problems commonly occurring.'),(3,'Male','Your dog\'s diet needs to have the right balance of all the main nutrient groups including a constant supply of fresh water. It\'s also important to conduct regular body condition scores to ensure you keep your dog in ideal shape and remember to feed him at least twice daily and in accordance with the feeding guidelines of his particular food.','01.>The Shiba Inu is a sturdy, medium-sized, Spitz-type dog (i.e. he has prick ears, a thick coat, and a curled tail). A smaller version of the Akita, adult males stand at around 39.5cm and adult females at 36.5cm. The thick, soft undercoat is covered in a hard, straight topcoat that comes in red, red sesame (red with black guard hairs), black and tan, or white. 02.>An alert, active and friendly dog, the Japanese Shiba Inu dog breed can be quite independent and often has a strong hunting instinct. Early, thorough socialisation is essential, particularly to help them be sociable with other dogs. An unusual feature of the breed is \'the Shiba scream\' – a high-pitched vocalisation emitted when excited or agitated.','The Shiba Inu is generally a healthy, robust breed. Like many breeds inherited eye problems can occur and breeding dogs should be routinely eye tested.'),(4,'Male','Large breed dogs, as well as having large appetites, benefit from a different balance of nutrients including minerals and vitamins compared to smaller-breed dogs. The Alaskan Malamute dog breed is prone to bloating and stomach problems; smaller, more frequent meals can help minimise this risk.','01.>A nomadic Inuit tribe from north-western Alaska, called the Mahlemuts, developed this breed to pull heavy loads in extremely harsh weather and to help with hunting. He shares his ancestry with other Arctic breeds, such as the Samoyed dog and the Siberian Husky breed, although he was not built for speed but for power. With his thick, double coat, strength and stamina, it\'s not surprising that the Malamute dog breed has helped to haul loads on polar expeditions – something few other breeds could withstand. 02.>He might look like a wolf, but he doesn\'t act like one! The Malamute dog is an affectionate, friendly dog, though perhaps not the ideal breed for a first-time owner. He loves to dig and howl and can have a high prey-drive for small, furry creatures – be they squirrels, cats or small dogs. Thorough early socialisation and ongoing training throughout his life – including work on a reliable recall – is therefore essential.','As with many breeds, Alaskan Malamute dogs can suffer from hereditary eye disorders, and hip dysplasia (a condition that can lead to mobility problems). Eye testing and hip scoring of dogs prior to breeding is therefore important.'),(5,'Female','Small dogs have a fast metabolism, meaning they burn energy at a high rate, although their small stomachs mean that they must eat little and often. Small-breed foods are specifically designed with appropriate levels of key nutrients and smaller kibble sizes to suit smaller mouths. This also encourages chewing and improves digestion.','01.>The American Cocker Spanie dog breed has its own distinct look from its English Cocker cousin, with a rounder skull and more profuse, glamorous coat. He weighs approximately 11kg when fully grown, and adult males measure 37-39cm in height, and females 34-37cm. The coat comes in a range of colours and combinations, with specific markings. See the breed standard for full details. 02.>Merry is a word often used to describe this breed. He should be equable, confident and cheerful. Early, thorough socialisation is recommended to ensure he doesn\'t grow up to be fearful of strangers or novelty. He may not be as large as many gundogs, but this intelligent dog likes being busy and enjoys playing games and spending time with his family. He usually dislikes being left alone for long periods of time.','One of the most common problems encountered in the American Cocker Spaniel dog breed is recurrent ear infections, due to their large ear flaps. As with many breeds, they can suffer from kneecaps that may temporarily slip out of place (luxating patellas), various hereditary eye disorders, and hip dysplasia (a condition that can lead to mobility problems). Eye testing and hip scoring of dogs prior to breeding is therefore important.'),(6,'Male','Small dogs have a fast metabolism, meaning they burn energy at a high rate, although their small stomachs mean that they must eat little and often. Small-breed foods are specifically designed with appropriate levels of key nutrients and smaller kibble sizes to suit smaller mouths. This also encourages chewing and improves digestion.','01.These sturdy and bold little dogs have kindly expressions and are compact and athletic. They have short coats that are dense and weather-resistant and come in a range of colours and patterns (see the breed standard for details). They stand at 33-40cm and weighs around 10-11kg. 02.>Beagles are good natured and, as they were bred to be pack animals, will get along with most other dogs. They love children but need to be exposed to cats at an early age in order to develop good relationships with them. The Beagle is a good watchdog, barking at anything unusual, although once the burglar is indoors, the Beagle may prefer a game with him!','Beagles are generally a robust and healthy breed. However as with many breeds, they can suffer from hip dysplasia (a condition that can lead to mobility problems). Hip scoring of dogs prior to breeding is therefore important. Epilepsy and a type of meningitis (Beagle pain syndrome) also occur more frequently in this breed.'),(7,'Male','Large breed dogs, as well as having large appetites, benefit from a different balance of nutrients including minerals and vitamins compared to smaller-breed dogs. Boxers are prone to bloating and stomach problems; smaller, more frequent meals can help minimise this risk.','01.>The Boxer dog is medium-sized, very muscular, sturdy and deep-chested. They have a short muzzle and a slightly upturned chin. The colour of the short coat comes in fawn and brindle, usually with some white markings; they can also be totally white in colour. The average height of adult males is 57-63cm, and their weight is 30-32kg. Adult females ideally stand at 53-59cm and weigh approximately 25-27kg. 02.>Boxer dogs remain puppy-like throughout their lives, making them quite a handful! Lively, strong and loyal, they make great pets for all the family, adults and children alike, but can be boisterous so may not be suitable in a home with very young kids. Fearless and very self-assured, they are not quick to pick a fight, but more than able to defend themselves if they have to. They can be very destructive if they are left alone at home for long periods of time.','Boxer dogs are predisposed to a variety of potentially serious diseases, in particular heart problems and cancers. Checking that dogs have been bred from lines that are free of these specific health problems will help reduce the likelihood of these disorders.'),(8,'Female','Your dog\'s diet needs to have the right balance of all the main nutrient groups including a constant supply of fresh water. It\'s also important to conduct regular body condition scores to ensure you keep your dog in ideal shape and remember to feed him at least twice daily and in accordance with the feeding guidelines of his particular food.','01.>The Bulldog breed has a short, sturdy body and fairly loose skin, especially at the head, neck and shoulders. Another distinctive feature is the large skull. The Bulldog can be brindle, shades of red, fawn or white with any of the aforementioned colours. The adult Bulldog stands at 31-36cm and weighs 23-25kg. 02.>This is a family dog that loves children and will even learn to get along with other pets if introduced to them at an early age. The Bulldog is a bit too friendly to be a good guard dog but would defend a family member in need. He can be peaceful, pensive, goofy, stubborn, and have a well-developed sense of humour.','The most common health problems encountered in the Bulldog relate to their very flat face, which results in obstruction of their airways and a difficulty in breathing. Over-exercising and over-heating is therefore to be avoided. They are also prone to skin infections, eye problems and hip and elbow dysplasia (joint conditions that can be painful and lead to mobility problems).'),(9,'Female','Toy-sized dogs have a fast metabolism, meaning they burn energy at a high rate, although their small stomachs mean that they must eat little and often. Small-breed foods are specifically designed with appropriate levels of key nutrients and smaller kibble sizes to suit smaller mouths. This also encourages chewing and improves digestion.','01.>The Miniature Wire-Haired Dachshund breed is a long-backed, short-legged dog of diminutive height. While small, the Dachshund is still muscular and powerfully built with a deep, broad chest and well-developed forelegs. He has a short, harsh coat with bushy eyebrows and a beard. The coat comes in a range of colours (see the breed standard for full details). The adult Miniature Dachshund weighs 4.5-5kg and is approximately 12-15cm in height. 02.>The Miniature Wire-Haired Dachshund can be very independent and needs kind, consistent, patient training. Early socialisation is required in order to acclimate Dachshunds to children, strangers and other animals. They are a breed that becomes quite attached to their family and usually one family member in particular, but they can be reserved with strangers.','The most common health problem seen in the Miniature Wire-Haired Dachshund is related to their body shape, making them prone to spinal disorders. Heart disease is also relatively common in the breed. As with many other breeds, various inherited eye disorders can be seen, and breeding dogs should be routinely eye tested.'),(10,'Female','Large breed dogs, as well as having large appetites, benefit from a different balance of nutrients including minerals and vitamins compared to smaller-breed dogs. Dobermanns are prone to bloating and stomach problems; smaller, more frequent meals can help minimise this risk.','01.>This is a moderately large, powerful, yet elegant animal. The coat is smooth, short and can come in brown, black, blue or fawn (also known as Isabella) with rust markings. The body carriage should be proud and each dog can be likened to a thoroughbred horse. Adult males measure around 69cm and adult females 65cm. The adult weighs around 32-45kg. 02.>Dobermann dogs need mental and physical activity. They must be properly trained, as a bored dog will develop behaviour problems. Socialised early with other dogs, pets and children, the Dobermann can make a lovely family pet. He is loyal and affectionate and will certainly protect the home. He does tend to be a \'one man dog\' though and will not tolerate teasing, so children must be taught how to behave around the dog. It is up to the owner to be responsible for their dog\'s behaviour. If you cannot put in the time, or are inexperienced with dogs, this is not the breed for you.','The most common health problems encountered in Dobermanns are heart disease, a problem with the vertebrae in the neck (Wobbler\'s syndrome) and von Willebrand\'s disease (a disorder of blood clotting). As with many breeds, they can suffer from various hereditary eye disorders, and hip dysplasia (a condition that can lead to mobility problems). Eye testing and hip scoring of dogs prior to breeding is therefore important.'),(11,'Male','Small dogs have a fast metabolism, meaning they burn energy at a high rate, although their small stomachs mean that they must eat little and often.

This also encourages chewing and improves digestion. 02.>The French Bulldog is a fun-loving dog, who is full of life and affectionate towards his loved ones. He is a courageous dog who thinks he is many times bigger than he actually is, and is unlikely to back down if picked on by another dog (some dogs cannot \'read\' the flat face and take exception to the Frenchie).','The most common health problems encountered in the French Bulldog relate to their flat face, which may result in obstruction of their airways and a difficulty in breathing. Over-exercising and over-heating is therefore to be avoided. They are also prone to skin infections, eye problems, hip and elbow dysplasia (joint conditions that can be painful and lead to mobility problems) and spinal disorders.'),(12,'Female','Large breed dogs, as well as having large appetites, benefit from a different balance of nutrients including minerals and vitamins compared to smaller-breed dogs. The German Shepherd dog can be prone to bloating and stomach problems; smaller, more frequent meals can help minimise this risk.','01.>German Shepherd Dogs are one of the most easily recognised breeds in the world. Their appearance should be of a muscular, alert dog with a noble and aloof attitude. The dogs are agile and well balanced and carry themselves with pride. Their coats come in a range of colours (see the breed standard) and consist of a hard, coarse and flat topcoat with a thick undercoat. The ideal height for adult males is 63cm and for females 58cm. The weight range is 30-36kg. 02.>The German Shepherd will develop a very close bond with his handler and will want to be with him/her as much as possible. Although this breed does need a lot of attention, he will give back one hundred fold with loyalty and incorruptible guarding skills. On the other hand, if you do not take the time to socialise and train a GSD, there will be problems with self-confidence and unruliness. This dog is eager to learn and very responsive to training so he should prove to be a stellar pupil in training classes.','The German Shepherd dog is predisposed to a number of problems including gastrointestinal diseases, a specific stomach condition (gastric dilation volvulus), a disease of the spinal cord and epilepsy. As with many other breeds, they can also suffer from hip and elbow dysplasia (joint conditions that can be painful and lead to mobility problems). Hip scoring of dogs prior to breeding is therefore important.'),(13,'Female','Large breed dogs, as well as having large appetites, benefit from a different balance of nutrients including minerals and vitamins compared to smaller-breed dogs.','01.>The short-haired German Pointer is a large, muscular, noble-looking dog, with adult males standing between 58-64cm and females at 53-59cm. They weigh approximately 25-32kg. The short, flat coat comes in various combinations and patterns of liver, white and black – see the breed standard for details. 02.>The short-haired German Pointer breed has keen hunting instincts and the energy to fulfil his original role as a working gundog. He makes a good companion for the active family who can attend to his needs and is known for being a loyal, gentle, loving, pet.','The short-haired German Pointer is generally a healthy breed. However, as with many breeds, they can suffer from various hereditary eye disorders and hip dysplasia (a condition that can lead to mobility problems).

The Golden Retriever is prone to bloating and stomach problems; smaller, more frequent meals can help minimise this risk.','01.>Known for his lustrous, medium-length golden coat, this large retriever has a friendly expression with perfect symmetry and superb, flowing movement covering the ground with long, powerful strides. Adult males are 56-61cm in height and 30-34kg. Adult females are 51-56cm and 27-32kg. 02.>The Golden Retriever is a gentle dog with a level disposition, and usually adapts well to family life. They love to be involved in all matters, whether indoors or outdoors. They are foremost a retriever and will attempt to drag, pull or carry anything they can fit into their mouths. They also love water and care should be taken to ensure their safety when any form of water is nearby. Golden Retrievers are, however, worriers, and great care should be taken during training, ensuring sensitivity is maintained at all times.','As with many breeds, The Golden Retriever can suffer from various hereditary eye disorders, and hip and elbow dysplasia (joint conditions that can be painful and lead to mobility problems). Eye testing and hip scoring of dogs prior to breeding is therefore important.'),(15,'Male','Giant-breed dogs, as well as having giant appetites, benefit from a different balance of minerals and vitamins, supporting different joint and cartilage needs. Great Danes are prone to bloating and stomach problems; try feeding smaller, more frequent meals to help minimise the risk.','01.>The Great Dane is a very large dog that is muscular and strong. The head is rectangular and long in appearance. The short, sleek coat can be fawn, black, blue, brindle and harlequin in colour. Over 18 months of age, the minimum height of dogs should ideally be 76cm and the weight 54kg. Females of the same age should be a minimum of 71cm and weigh 46kg. 02.>The Great Dane is an affectionate dog. They can become very close and loyal to their family and close family friends that are frequent visitors, and are ideally suited to the active family. They are quick to alert the family of any strangers approaching their territory, as they are excellent guard dogs. Puppy socialisation and training is of particular importance in such a canine giant.','The Great Dane is predisposed to a number of problems that are common in large breeds of dog, including a specific stomach condition (gastric dilation volvulus), heart disease, a variety of bone disorders, and a particular type of aggressive bone tumour (osteosarcoma).'),(16,'Male','Large breed dogs, as well as having large appetites, benefit from a different balance of nutrients including minerals and vitamins compared to smaller-breed dogs. The Labrador is prone to bloating and stomach problems; smaller, more frequent meals can help minimise this risk.','01.>Labrador dogs are large, strongly built dogs with good bone and substance. Their heads are broad with soft, intelligent eyes. Their tails are totally unique being otter-like. The short, dense coat comes in solid black, yellow and chocolate/liver. Adult dogs measure 56-57cm and weigh about 30kg and adult females are 55-56cm and weigh about 28kg. 02.>The Labrador breed is definitely in the top three when it comes to choosing a family pet - as long as you enjoy exercise! They are friendly, good-natured dogs who are affectionate with everyone. They are adaptable social dogs who can bond well with other animals and children, being patient and forgiving but this should never be abused. They are extremely loyal and love to be included in all aspects of family life. Labradors will bark to draw your attention to strangers but will welcome them with open arms.','As with many breeds, Labrador dogs can suffer from various hereditary eye disorders, and hip and elbow dysplasia (joint conditions that can be painful and lead to mobility problems).

Their straight, medium-length coat is waterproof and can be red, sable, fawn, black and tan, with or without white markings. Adult Pembrokes measure 25-30cm, with males weighing in at 10-12kg and females at 9-11kg. 02.>The Pembroke Corgi is a generally obedient, active little dog. They are bold, outgoing and friendly - big dogs in little bodies. They are obedient and are loyal to the family and are ideally suited to an active, busy home. They make good watchdogs, being alert in the home, and keen to announce any visitors.','The Welsh Corgi (Pembroke) is generally a very hardy breed.

They can be seen in many colours, including blue, grey, silver, brown, apricot and cream. See the breed standard for full details. The adult Miniature Poodle is 28-38cm in height and weighs 12-14kg. 02.>Lively, sociable and affectionate, Miniature Poodles make wonderful companion dogs. They enjoy a busy life and love to be included in all family pursuits. Miniature Poodles adapt to life in more confined quarters as long as they get adequate exercise. They can be good watch dogs, announcing visitors but never being aggressive.','Like many small breeds, the miniature Poodle can suffer from kneecaps that may temporarily slip out of place (luxating patellas). They are also prone to a hip condition and an inherited eye disorder that should be tested for.'),(19,'Male','Large breed dogs, as well as having large appetites, benefit from a different balance of nutrients including minerals and vitamins compared to smaller-breed dogs. Rottweilers are also prone to bloating and stomach problems; smaller, more frequent meals can help minimise this risk.','01.>Rottweiler dogs (or \'Rotties\') are large, compact dogs known for their solid black coats with clearly defined rust-coloured markings. They are strong and powerful dogs for their size. For their size, Rottweilers are very agile and capable of running and jumping with ease. Adult females stand at 58-64cm and weigh around 38kg, while adult males measure 63-69cm and weigh around 50kg. 02.>Rottweilers are unconditionally loyal to their handlers and their families and will naturally defend them and their property. A popular breed with unscrupulous breeders, it\'s important to find a well-bred, well-socialised pup, as temperaments can vary. The importance of socialisation and training from an early age cannot be overstressed! This breed is not suited to the novice/inexperienced owner.','In common with many large breeds the Rottweiler dog may suffer from a specific stomach condition (gastric dilation volvulus) and hip dysplasia (a condition that can lead to mobility problems). Hip scoring of dogs prior to breeding is therefore important.'),(20,'Female','Your dog\'s diet needs to have the right balance of all the main nutrient groups including a constant supply of fresh water. It\'s important to conduct regular body condition scores to ensure you keep your dog in ideal shape and remember to feed him at least twice daily and in accordance with the feeding guidelines of his particular food.','01.>These are medium-sized dogs whose proportions suggest a balance of power, speed and endurance. With a double-layered, medium-length coat, erect ears and a brush tail, this breed comes in all colours and markings, including white, with some striking patterns being seen. Adult males stand at 53-60cm, females at 51-56cm. Adult males weigh 20-27kg, adult females 16-23kg. 02.>The breed is known for its good temperament and its love of people means they don\'t make natural guard dogs. They love and need company and should not be left alone for long periods of time or they can become very destructive. They will be happy with other well-adjusted dogs but are keen and efficient hunters so contact with other household animals needs careful handling and training. Whilst they do not often bark, they will howl, often just for the joy of it!','The Siberian Husky is generally a healthy, hardy breed. However, as with many breeds, they can suffer from hereditary eye disorders and occasionally hip dysplasia (a condition that can lead to mobility problems). Eye testing and hip scoring of dogs prior to breeding is therefore important.'),(22,'Male','First and most important thing which you must know is that Dalmatians actually lack a specific enzyme which is used to help digest proteins. They are actually the only breed that lacks this enzyme, all other dogs have it. This enzyme helps digest foods that are very heavily dense in protein','01.>The Dalmatian is a breed of medium-sized dog, noted for its unique black or liver spotted coat and mainly used as a carriage dog in its early days. Its roots trace back to Croatia and its historical region of Dalmatia\r\n02.>Last but not the least it is a good dog','Having said that, before we continue let me just say that Dalmatians are relatively healthy overall. When I say �common� health problems, I don�t mean that these problems are common for all Dalmatians. Majority of them won�t have to deal with most of these of these problems at all, but being aware of what could go wrong is important.'),(23,'Female','Border Collies originated in northern England and Scotland, primarily for herding sheep and other livestock. In fact, they are still often used for herding, and have a strong desire to work. Although Border Collies do make good pets, their high-energy level and need for mental stimulation make them sometimes a poor choice for novice dog owners.','01.>The Border Collie is a working and herding dog breed developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region for herding livestock, especially sheep. It was specifically bred for intelligence and obedience.\r\n02.>Considered highly intelligent, extremely energetic, acrobatic and athletic, they frequently compete with great success in sheepdog trials and dog sports. They are often cited as the most intelligent of all domestic dogs.[1] Border Collies continue to be employed in their traditional work of herding livestock throughout the world.','The natural life span of the Border Collie is between 10 and 14 years, with an average lifespan of 12 years.[9] The median longevities of breeds of similar size are usually 12 to 13 years.[10]\r\n\r\nLeading causes of death are cancer (23.6%), old age (17.9%) and cerebral vascular afflictions (9.4%)'),(24,'Male','Shetland Sheep are a unique breed. They are short and hardy and produce wool for Shetland\'s famous knitwear industry. They also a source of high quality meat. Reestit mutton was a traditional way of storing meat so that it can be eaten in slices through the winter','01.>The Shetland Sheepdog, also known as the Sheltie, is a breed of herding dog that originated in the Shetland Islands. The original name of this breed was Shetland Collie, but when this caused controversy among the Rough Collie breeders of the time, the breed\'s name was formally changed to Shetland Sheepdog. \r\n02.>This hard-working small dog is intelligent, vocal, excitable and willing to please. They are incredibly loyal to their owners and are often referred to as \"shadows\" due to their attachment to family','For the most part, Shelties are athletic and healthy. Like the Rough Collie, there is a tendency toward inherited malformation and disease of the eyes. Each individual puppy should have his/her eyes examined by a qualified veterinary ophthalmologist. Some lines may be susceptible to hypothyroidism, epilepsy, hip dysplasia, or skin allergies.'),(25,'Male','Adults. Adult pit bulls usually need to eat around 20 pounds of dry dog food a month. It is better to feed your adult pit bull a cup of food two or even three times a day. This is better on their digestive system versus feeding them one large meal a day','01.>Pit bull is the common name for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers. Formal breeds often considered to be of the pit bull type include the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier.[1][2] The American Bulldog is also sometimes included\r\n02.> Mixed-breed dogs which physically resemble these breeds often get labelled as \"pit bulls\" by shelters. Many of these breeds were originally developed as fighting dogs from cross breeding bull-baiting dogs (used to hold the faces and heads of larger animals such as bulls) and terriers.','Violent interactions between humans and canines have been studied by the US government, notably the Center for Disease Control and Prevention,[28] as well as academic veterinary researchers. The interpretation of these studies, breed identification and relevance issues, and variable circumstances have given rise to intense controversy'),(26,'Male','Regular Dog Food.Regular Exercise will be good.','01.>The Pomeranian (often known as a Pom) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe.02.> Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from the larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically the German Spitz. It has been determined by the F?d?ration Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as the Zwergspitz (\"Dwarf-Spitz\").\r\n','The life expectancy of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and fit, a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog.The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian\'s lightweight build.');
